## Troubleshooting

**"Cannot resolve symbol 'shri_lekhan_logo'"**

- File must be named exactly `shri_lekhan_logo.png` (lowercase, underscore, .png)
- Must be in `drawable` folder (not in any subfolder)
- Clean and rebuild project

**Logo looks blurry**

- Use higher resolution (minimum 800x800 pixels)

**Logo doesn't appear**

- Make sure you deleted `shri_lekhan_logo.xml` placeholder
- Only keep `shri_lekhan_logo.png` file

---

## That's It!

Once you add `shri_lekhan_logo.png` to the drawable folder, your beautiful logo will appear
throughout the app! 🎉
